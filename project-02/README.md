# Project 2 Usage Instructions

To run all agents in all environments for 250 iterations, simply run `python main.py`

To run a specific agent or environment rum `python main.py <env_name> <alg_name> <num_iter>`

Where `<env_name>` is the name of environment you would like to run, either `cart-pole`, `mountain-car`, or `<all>`

Where `<alg_name>` is the name of the algorithm to be used, either `<dqn>`, `<d2qn>`, or `<all>`

Where `<num_iter>` is the number of iterations to run, which  should be greater than 1
